# Exercise: a small diagram chase

Let U, V, W be vector spaces, and f : U → V an injective linear map,
and g : V → W a surjective linear map, such that the kernel of g coincides
with the range of f. In diagrammatic terms, we have the short exact sequence:

                 f        g
    0 -----> U -----> V -----> W -----> 0 .

(f embeds U into V, and g projects from V to W
and we have "exactness in the middle": ker g = ran f)

Since g is assumed surjective, there exist "sections" σ of the above, i.e.,
linear maps σ : W → V such that g(σ(w)) = w for every w ∈ W, i.e, the following
square commutes (the vertical arrows are identity maps).

                 f        g
    0 -----> U -----> V -----> W -----> 0 .
                      ∧        ∧
                      |        |
                      V <----- W
                           σ

Fix a choice σ of such a section. The goal of this exercise is to do in Lean
the small diagram chase needed to construct a linear map γ : V → U uniquely
determined by the condition that v = σ(g(v)) + f(γ(v)) for any v ∈ V.

                 f        g
    0 -----> U -----> V -----> W -----> 0 .
             ∧        :
             |        :
             U <----- V
                  γ

Let us call that map γ the "corrector (linear) map" for the lack of better
term, because it describes by which embedded element of U in V the vector
v differs from σ(g(v)).
In other words, any v ∈ V gets uniquely decomposed to a vector σ(g(v)) in
the image of the section σ and a "corrector term" f(γ(v)) in the image of
the embedding f. This gives a direct sum decomposition of V (V ≃ U ⊕ W).
One last reinterpretation is that using (id_V - σ ∘ g) : V → V as a map
vertically in the middle ":" would make the completed square commute.

(Situations of this kind appear very frequently in mathematics; this is
essentially the simplest case of "diagram chasing" arguments
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_diagram#Diagram_chasing>.)

We have defined a function `γ : V → U` which obviously must be linear, because all
conditions involved in its unique construction were linear. But Lean does not know
that; we need to tell it to Lean.

So our goal is to promote the function `γ : V → U` to a linear map `γ : V → U`.
That promoted version of `corrector` will will be `correctorHom` below. The two
properties that we need to prove are that `γ` (i.e., `corrector`) respects addition
and scalar multiplication.

      = c • corrector hfg hgσ v := by
  -- Make sure you know the maths proof first. It uses earlier results.
